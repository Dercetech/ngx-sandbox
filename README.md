# Sandbox template: basic sandbox
Hi,
This sandbox makes the following features available for a testbed:
* material
* flex layout
* rxjs

The master template has an additional feature: It adds routing. And routing can add an extra layer of overhead for newcomers to Angular.

## How to use
See the README.md available on the master branch.
