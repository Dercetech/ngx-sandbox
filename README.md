# Jem's Angular 5 Sandbox
Hi,
This repository lists one branch per topic.

## How to use

Some documentation I've written has possibly led you here. Keep in mind that the master branch is meant to initialize your local clone of the project, per-se, you should run the initial npm install from here before switching to a branch. I keep the package.json file as close as possible to the master one, only adding the sandbox branches specific needs.
